/**
 * A {@link DsgmProtocol} is an implementation of a Decentralized Group Messaging protocol, which is
 * a complete end-to-end encrypted group messaging protocol, designed to work on top of a network
 * that provides reliable at-least-once broadcast message delivery but not other delivery or security
 * requirements.
 * <p>
 * To use a DgmProtocol, an application initializes a {@link DsgmProtocol} instance.
 * The application can then use {@link DsgmProtocol#create} to create a new group,
 * {@link DsgmProtocol#add} to add a user the current group, {@link DsgmProtocol#remove} to
 * remove a group member, {@link DsgmProtocol#update} to issue an update for post-compromise security,
 * or {@link DsgmProtocol#send} to encrypt a message.  In any case, the returned message should be
 * broadcast to other group members, who then call {@link DsgmProtocol#receive} on it.
 * This method returns the results of processing all messages that become ready as a result of the received
 * message (i.e., all of their necessary predecessors have been received).  Invalid messages are
 * ignored.  Note that {@link DsgmProtocol#receive} should not be called on our own messages, in
 * contrast to {@link DcgkaProtocol}.
 * <p>
 * {@link DsgmProtocol} objects should be immutable.  "Mutating" methods must return a new
 * {@link DsgmProtocol} while leaving the original unchanged.
 * <p>
 * Specific rules for message delivery:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Messages should be broadcast to all current group members, except for a welcome
 *     message returned by {@link DsgmProtocol#add}, which need only be sent to the added user.</li>
 *     <li>Messages output by methods besides {@link DsgmProtocol#send} should
 *     also be broadcast to all concurrently added group members, as described in the paper draft.
 *     Depending on the precise protocol implementation, this may also be required for
 *     outputs of {@link DsgmProtocol#send}.</li>
 *     <li>Messages should be delivered at least once, but multiple times is okay.</li>
 *     <li>Including extra unrelated or even malicious messages is okay.</li>
 * </ul>
 * However, all group members are assumed to honestly follow the protocol.
 * <p>
